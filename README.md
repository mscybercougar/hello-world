Hey Everyone!

I'm new to GitHub and a novice at programming. I am primarily interested in learning any of the scripting languages,
(primarily Python), but would like to learn compiled languages (such as C# and Java (to bytecode)) as well. :) 

Oh! I completely forgot to mention that I love to snowboard as well. :)
